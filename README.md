# CSS-Project-Mintlify-Page
# Mintlify Homepage UI Clone (Desktop-Focused)
  This project is a desktop-focused UI recreation inspired by the official Mintlify developer tool website. It was built using pure HTML and CSS as part of a frontend practice assignment.

  The aim of the project was to analyze and reproduce a modern SaaS landing page design, paying close attention to layout structure, spacing, typography choices, and color balance. Rather than functionality, the focus is entirely on visual accuracy and clean styling.
